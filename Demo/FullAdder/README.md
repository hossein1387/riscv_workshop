# A basic chisel project

This is based on [chisel-template](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-template) repository but without example dirs!

To use this repository, first clone it:

    git clone https://github.com/hossein1387/BaseChiselProj.git

To use this repository with IntelliJ IDEA run the project from command line by running:

    sbt test

And then import the project in IntelliJ as an sbt project. For some reason, if you don't run the project before importing it to InjtelliJ, Injtellij would not be able to find chisel dependency.
