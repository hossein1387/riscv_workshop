The lab is partially complete and you need to fill out the rest to make the test pass.

There are four designs in src/main/scala/problems/ as follow:

    Accumulator.scala   Adder.scala     Counter.scala       Mux4.scala

You need to fill out thoes parts that is between **Modify below** and **Modify above**.

To run the test for your design, run the following command:

    ./run-problem.sh [TEST_NAME]

For instance for testing *Accumulator* you need to run the following command:
